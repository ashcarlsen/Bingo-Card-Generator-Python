UML Phase 0

This diagram is a great start at understanding the concepts of this program. I believe that it is very good at showing what data members and methods are being used in the classes. However, I can see several different things that would be an improvement on the updated version. For instance, the methods do not have a return type connected with them. It is very hard to see what is going to be outputted from those functions. I think it would be a good improvement to add those in. I also think that you should go over which methods are private and which are going to be public. I believe that there are a few on there that are wrong. One more thing that definitely needs to be implemented into the next phase of the UML diagram is arrows or relationships. There is not anything to determine which classes work with each other. For example, the card class looks like it stands alone. However, it will be used in the deck class. There also needs to be a relationship between the random number set class and the card class. The card will use this number set class to populate the bingo squares. Another example of this is with the menu class. The menu options need to have a relationship shown between them and the actual menu itself. The menu then needs to be shown how it works with the User Interface class. I think that adding these few simple things will make this diagram improve very much.

I think that this UML diagram is very well put together. The diagram contains all of the necessary classes and features that were included in the program. The one main issue that I see with this UML diagram is spacing. When displayed on my screen the RandNumberSet class is down on its own page. This makes it very hard to follow where it is connected. I would suggest sliding every single class over. If you could start on the very left side of the page with your main User Interface class, then the other classes would connect nicely to in. They would then have plenty of room to fit nicely and display their relationships with each other better. One thing that I liked about your UML diagram is including which data type the class members are going to be. For example, in the Deck class, cardSize is shown as in integer. The only problem I can see along with this is consistency. Not all data members are shown in the same way as cardSize was. If you added that feature into the rest of the classes then it would be a great addition! I think that I’m going to add this into my UML diagram as well. I also like the use of text between classes. They explain the relationships between the classes very well. One thing that might be helpful to add in is other relationships. For example, the Card class is shown to be stored inside of the deck. However, where is the Card class created. In my own, the card is created by the Deck and stored in there. Overall this is a great diagram! Good work!

### Review from Tyler Blackham

The Diagram is very well organized and easy to understand. It shows
the relationships between the different classes and all of the 
information that they use.

Honestly the only suggestions I can think of is adding the return
types for all of the Data Members, such as MAX_SIZE in RandNumberSet 
and such. And also adding in within the parentheses the list of 
parameters that each method deals with in the class.

You could also move your Menu and MenuOption classes up so that the 
Diagram as a whole doesn't take up too much space, but that's not too 
big of a deal honestly.

For the most part, this UML diagram is very easy to follow and well written. All the classes that were required to be added were there, and all of the associations are easy to follow and correct (to my understanding). There is one association I would add, however, this association would be between the menu and the UserInterface class. They directly use and build off of each other. Some classes are italicized, while the others are not, I would make that consistent throughout your UML, unless you have a reason for that. Your UML contains all the data members and other variables it needs, along with their corresponding types (Boolean, string, integer, etc.). I like that the association arrows all have how the associations work (“Used by”). This is very helpful in organizing the UML and creating a clear understanding of the program, and how it is meant to function/ will function.
This UML is very structured and contains a good format, this would have a good effect if someone (a customer) were to read this expecting to get some insight on how the program would work. If a simple understanding of Bingo cards is achieved by the customer, they would be able tell how the program would work. Along with the customer, it would be even more helpful if working on a team of developers. This being said, your UML diagram is very helpful and well put together, it should assist you while continuing the design of your program.
